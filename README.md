# Security-Checks-Automation
It automates the works and increase the security.
In Automates the things like Alexa bulbs and fans do but it doesn't work like that . In Alexa fans and bulbs people had to buy the bulb and fans of Alexa only but through our model there will be no need of buying bulb and fans of particular switches .
We will work with the switches and will automate the switches that will be connected through our software and will work on voice commands that will have a face lock and secure code to turn it on. After turning it on we can automate the switches that can be used with our phone only there will be no need to turn on any switches by physical press.
In security terms we will have our cameras at the main door connected through our software and our software will have the data of our know persons that we will provide to our software like we upload photo on social media platforms  with captions . Suppose we have a person whose data is saved in our software and he comes at door then our software will automatically detect him and tell us his or her name that is saved in our data ,it will tell the number of persons out there  ,if any unknown person is there then it will capture image and show it on mobile screen the through that we can talk to the person with the speaker and microphone installed at door.
